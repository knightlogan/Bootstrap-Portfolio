                        <p>My name is Logan Knight. I was born in Memphis, TN but have lived in North Carolina for most of my life. I received my undergraduate degree form Appalachian State University and my MBA from East Carolina University.

                        I love the outdoors and when I was 26 I went to live in New Zealand and Australia for 3 years. After that I returned back to North Carolina to finish my degree.

                        I moved to Raleigh from Denver, CO where I worked as a tax analyst and snowboard instructor. During the summers I would also work as a bike mechanic and mountain bike instructor.

                        I grew up playing all different kind of sports, but my favorite was always football and boxing. My dad and I have had season tickets to the Carolina Panthers since their first year in 1995.

                        I recently got engaged to my beautiful fiance, Jennifer; so when I'm not working or going to class I'm spending time with her and my 5 year old chocolate lab who loves to swim in Falls Lake.
